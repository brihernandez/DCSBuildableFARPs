# Moveable FARPs Proof of Concept

Saw this feature on a server and they wouldn't explain how they did it, so I wanted to try recreating it. Basically you can move around the Invisible FARP using mist.teleportToPoint. More complicated uses of this, when combined with the slot blocker, could be to allow players to "build" FARPs at arbitrary points on the map as forward bases.

This is insanely cool, and I think there's a lot of potential uses for this on online servers. Many thanks to EatLeadCobra for figuring this out!
